Project Goal: The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical video game sales data to identify key patterns and factors that contribute to a game's success. By understanding these trends, the online store Ice can make data-driven decisions to optimize advertising campaigns and inventory planning for 2017, ultimately maximizing revenue.

Key Steps: Data Exp

loration & Cleaning

Assess data quality (missing values, duplicates, outliers).

Handle inconsistencies in game names, platforms, genres, and ratings.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze sales trends across regions (NA, EU, JP, others).

Compare performance across platforms, genres, and ESRB ratings.

Identify top-selling games and their characteristics.

Identifying Success Patterns

Determine which platforms and genres perform best.

Examine the impact of critic & user reviews on sales.

Assess whether ESRB ratings influence sales in different regions.

Forecasting & Recommendations

Predict trends for 2017 based on historical data.

Suggest which games/platforms to prioritize in marketing campaigns.

Progress & Purpose: Progress: The dataset includes sales, platform, genre, and rating data up to 2016. The next step is cleaning, analyzing trends, and modeling.

Purpose: The findings will help Ice allocate advertising budgets effectively, stock high-potential games, and tailor promotions to the right audience (e.g., focusing on "Teen"-rated action games in North America if they perform well).

Expected Outcomes: A clear understanding of what makes a game successful (e.g., platform, genre, rating).

Actionable insights for strategic planning in 2017.

This project will not only improve Iceâ€™s business decisions but also serve as valuable practice in data analysis and trend forecasting.
